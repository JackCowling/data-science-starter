# data-science-starter
Repo containing initial setup for a data science project

> The repo was developed and tested in a Linux environment. Certain functionality will not work on other operating systems (especially windows). For anyone developing on windows - I highly recommend getting WSL 2 (windows subsystem for linux), and using it to run a linux environment on your windows machine. See here <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10>
